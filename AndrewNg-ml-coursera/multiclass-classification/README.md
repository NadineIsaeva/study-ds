My solutions for the 3rd programming exercise in Coursera ML with Andrew Ng

One-vs-all logistic regression: having subset of [MNIST handwritten digits dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/),
predict labels (1..10) for images

Neural networks: the same task, already trained parameters. Forward propagation - [predict.m](./predict.m) file
