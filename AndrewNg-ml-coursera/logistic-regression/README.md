My solutions for the 2nd programming exercise in Coursera ML with Andrew Ng

Logistic regression for classification: having simple dataset with students' scores for two exams, 
predict whether or not a student will be admitted to university

Regularized LR for classification: having simple dataset with test results for microchips, 
predict whether or not microchips will pass QA. Using regularization in order to prevent overfitting
after adding polynomial features ([mapFeature.m](./mapFeature.m) file)
