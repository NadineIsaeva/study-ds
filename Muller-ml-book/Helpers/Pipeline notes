🤖️ Any process that extracts knowledge from the dataset should only be applied to training portion of dataset,
so any CV should be 'outermost loop' in processing.

🤖️ Requirement for estimators in Pipeline: all but the last step need to have a transform method, so they can produce a new
representation of data to be used in the next step.

🤖️ The last step of the Pipeline is required to have a fit method.

🤖️ Pipelines - as a way to encapsulate all preprocessing steps in ML workflow into a single sklearn estimator.

🤖️ Searching over preprocessing parameters together with model parameters is a very powerful strategy.

👾️ Adding more parameters to grid_params exponentially increases number of models to be built.

🤖️ It is possible to search over the actual steps being performed in the pipeline (not best practice).
